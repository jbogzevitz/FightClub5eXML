Make a ranged spell attack against a target, on a hit the infection does 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. If the target is suffering from the poisoned condition or a disease, it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage.

This spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

    <text>For the spell's duration, your tongue becomes an elongated tether of necrotic green energy you can use to drink the vitality of other creatures. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target gains 1 level of exhaustion, and you regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to target the same creature or a different one, but can't target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of stream of consumption.

While poisoned in this way, the target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. It takes 2d4 poison damage on a failed saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on that target.
A lesser restoration spell cast on the target ends this spell early.

    <text>For the spell's duration, your hand secretes sticky burning acid which you can use to hold a creature in a painful clutch. When you cast this spell, and as an action on your turn until the spell ends, you can make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet
of you. On a hit, you deal 4d4 acid damage to the target, and the creature is restrained in your acidic grip until the end of your next turn. You can attack the same target round after round, or choose
a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.
A creature restrained by your grip can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained. Each time a creature ends its turn restrained by this spell, it takes an additional 4d4 acid damage.
At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

    In addition, on a failed saving throw the ghostly hands grapple the target until the end of your next turn, and immediately move the target up to 30 feet in a direction of your choice (but not upward). On its turn, the creature can use an action to attempt to escape the grapple by making a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, the grapple ends.
At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the grasping ghost can target one additional creature within range for each spell level above 2nd.
