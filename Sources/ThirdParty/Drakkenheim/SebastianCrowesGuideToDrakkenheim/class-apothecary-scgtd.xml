          <name>Apothecary Magic</name>
        <text>Your arcane research has given you facility with spells. Refer to the Core Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing in this book for the apothecary spell list.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Formula Book</text>
        <text>You have a book or collection of notes that you study to prepare your apothecary spells, develop your esoteric theories, and record your occult practices. You may use your formula book as an arcane focus for your apothecary spells. You may describe this book any way you like. Some examples of your book’s appearance include:</text>
        <text>• A large leatherbound tome with yellowing pages bound shut with an iron lock</text>
        <text>• A scattered assortment of scribbled notes loosely held together by rope</text>
        <text>• A pristine journal with perfect edges and beautiful penmanship</text>
        <text>• A leather briefcase with two small golden locks</text>
        <text>• A medical bag with surgical symbols on the sides</text>
        <text>• A beat-up satchel slung over one shoulder with vials and bottles poking out of every pocket</text>
        <text>If the book is destroyed or lost, you can recreate it using inks and paper during a long rest.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Cantrips:</text>
        <text>   You know three cantrips of your choice from the apothecary spell list. You learn additional apothecary cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Apothecary table.</text>
        <text>   Elementary Reformulation: Whenever you finish a long rest and consult your formula book, you can replace one apothecary cantrip you know with another cantrip from the apothecary spell list.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Spell Slots:</text>
        <text>   The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
        <text>   For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>
        <text>  The Apothecary table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your apothecary spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your apothecary spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
        <text>  You prepare the list of apothecary spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the apothecary spell list. When you do so, choose a number of apothecary spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + your apothecary level (minimum of one spell). A spell you prepare must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the Apothecary table's Slot Level column for your level.</text>
        <text>  For example, if you are a 5th-level apothecary, you have three 3rd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include eight spells of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level, in any combination. To cast the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. Casting a spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
        <text>  You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of apothecary spells requires at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
        <text>   Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your apothecary spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an apothecary spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Ritual Casting:</text>
        <text>   You can cast an apothecary spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>
        <text>   You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your apothecary spells.</text>

        <text>As a bonus action, you may expend a spell slot to undergo a grotesque transformation. The transformation ends after one minute, or if you are reduced to 0 hit points or incapacitated. When you undergo this transformation you maintain your personality, alignment, and game statistics. However, several changes occur:</text>
        <text>• Your Strength and Intelligence ability scores are swapped.</text>
        <text>• Your size becomes Large, your jump distance is doubled, and you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</text>
        <text>• Each of your hands transform into a big meaty fist, which you can use to make melee weapon attacks. It counts as a simple weapon for you. Your big meaty fists deal 1d10 + your Strength modifier + your Apothecary level bludgeoning damage on a hit. h You cannot cast or concentrate on spells.</text>
        <text>• You have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</text>
        <text>• You gain temporary hit points equal to five times your Apothecary level.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>You also amplify your abilities based on the potency of your concoction. This is related to the spell slot you used to undergo the transformation:</text>
        <text>• Your speed increases by 5 feet per level of spell slot used.</text>
        <text>• Your AC is 13 + the level of spell slot used.</text>
        <text>• At the start of each of your turns and as long as you have at least 1 hit point remaining, you regain a number of hit points equal to the level of the spell slot used.</text>

You now have the ability to maintain concentration on spells while in your transmogrified form. While transmogrified, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.</text>

        <text>You have perfected your Transmogrifying Elixir, breaking the confines of evolution and pushing your form to what you deem the apex of evolution. You gain the following benefits while transmogrified:</text>
        <text>• As long as you have one or more hit points remaining, you can use a bonus action and expend a spell slot to regain hit points equal to ten times the level of the spell slot used.</text>
        <text>• If you fail a saving throw, as a reaction you can expend a spell slot to succeed instead.</text>
        <text>• Your Strength score becomes equal to your Intelligence score when transmogrified. Additionally, you can cast spells while in your transmogrified form.</text>

        <text>At 20th level, you can spend 5 minutes channeling power into a number of creatures (which can include yourself) equal to your Intelligence modifier to facilitate an abnormally fast recovery. You must tend to the creatures during this period, using a healer's kit with at least one use remaining. The targets regain hit points, spell slots, hit dice, and other abilities as if they completed a long rest. A creature can only benefit from one Miraculous Recovery in a 24-hour period. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</text>
